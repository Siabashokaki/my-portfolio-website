# TODO: Fix Hover Shadow Issue Later

- Investigate why the custom Tailwind CSS shadow class `hover:shadow-black` is not applying correctly.
- Consider renaming `tailwind.config.js` to `tailwind.config.mjs` for ES module compatibility.
- Explore alternative approaches such as inline styles or CSS modules for hover shadow effect.
- Ensure the development server is restarted after Tailwind config changes.
- Test thoroughly on the About section hover shadow effect.
- Confirm no conflicts or overrides in CSS affecting the shadow.
- Update the About.jsx component with a working hover shadow solution.
